# Commands

{% hint style="danger" %}
None of these commands are actually implemented. This is a placeholder for command ideas and implementations for the time being. After a while, all commands here will be implemented and new command ideas will be on the issue report tracker under feature requests.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Many of the commands on this page may have one or more _alias_ commands between brackets behind their main title. This means that you can also run that command with the alias. Example: `/or std o`does the same as `/or studio open`

Any parameter in between `[` and `]` is optional, meaning they can be omitted. Parameters between `<` and `>` cannot be omitted.

Please let us know if there are any malfunctioning guides here, or if you want to add or change information to/on this page.
{% endhint %}
